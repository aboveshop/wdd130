      <p>ðŸš€ Passionate about crafting robust backend systems and driving innovation through secure coding practices and performance optimization in Node.js, Go and Python. With over 5 years of hands-on experience, I've led initiatives to enhance application security, reduce fraud incidents, and streamline development processes for organizations ranging from startups to enterprises.</p>

      <p>ðŸ’¡ I thrive on solving complex challenges and delivering tangible results. Notable achievements include eliminating sensitive information exposure, reducing fraud incidents by 75% through a distributed 2FA authentication system, and achieving a 33% increase in task delivery efficiency by streamlining development processes as a Tech Lead.</p>

      <p>ðŸ”’ My commitment to continuous learning is reflected in my pursuit of advanced certifications, including JSNAD, JSExpert, and AWS Serverless. I leverage this expertise to implement best practices in secure development, DevSecOps, and cloud computing, driving tangible cost savings and performance improvements for clients.</p>

      <p>ðŸŒ± Always eager to expand my knowledge and stay ahead of industry trends, I actively contribute to the Node.js community through thought leadership, educational content, and collaboration with fellow developers.

      <p>GoiÃ¡s is in the center of Brazil, know by its country music, farms, and cowboys. Some would say that it is the Brazillian Texas, and somehow it is true.</p>
