      <p>ðŸš€ Passionate about crafting robust backend systems and driving innovation through secure coding practices and performance optimization in Node.js, Go and Python. With over 5 years of hands-on experience, I've led initiatives to enhance application security, reduce fraud incidents, and streamline development processes for organizations ranging from startups to enterprises.

ðŸ’¡ I thrive on solving complex challenges and delivering tangible results. Notable achievements include eliminating sensitive information exposure, reducing fraud incidents by 75% through a distributed 2FA authentication system, and achieving a 33% increase in task delivery efficiency by streamlining development processes as a Tech Lead.

ðŸ”’ My commitment to continuous learning is reflected in my pursuit of advanced certifications, including JSNAD, JSExpert, and AWS Serverless. I leverage this expertise to implement best practices in secure development, DevSecOps, and cloud computing, driving tangible cost savings and performance improvements for clients.

ðŸŒ± Always eager to expand my knowledge and stay ahead of industry trends, I actively contribute to the Node.js community through thought leadership, educational content, and collaboration with fellow developers. Let's connect to explore opportunities for collaboration, consultation, or simply to share insights and ideas!</p>
